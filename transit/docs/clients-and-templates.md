It is highly recommended to set up clients and templates before creating schedules. Doing so will make creating recurring trips easier and less prone to typo errors.

#### Clients

The __[Clients](/transit/clients/)__ page can be accessed via the main menu under *Schedule >> Edit Clients*.

The clients created here will appear in the drop-down of the __Name__ field when creating trips in a template or schedule.

The available fields when creating a client are fairly straight-forward:

- __Name__ - The client's full name
- __Address__ - The client's home address
- __Phone__ - The client's home and/or cell phone number
- __Elderly__ - Is the client elderly?
- __Ambulatory__ - Is the client ambulatory?
- __Tags__ - A list of user-defined labels, separated by commas.
