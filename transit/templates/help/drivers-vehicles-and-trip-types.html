<p>Before using the schedule system, it is important to first set up the available <strong>drivers</strong> and <strong>vehicles</strong>, as well as the different <strong>trip types</strong>.</p>

<p>Your administrator has likely already done this for you, but it is worth reviewing this section to learn how to add, edit, and re-order these items.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Drivers</h4>

<p>The <strong><a href="{% url 'drivers' %}">Drivers</a></strong> page can be accessed via the main menu under <em>Schedule &gt;&gt; Drivers</em>.</p>

<div class="help-img">
    <img src="{% static '/transit/img/help_drivers_list.png' %}" alt="The drivers page" />
    <div class="help-img-text help-img-text-left" style="left: 180px; top: 20px;">Create a new driver</div>
    <div class="help-img-text help-img-text-left" style="left: 110px; top: 90px;">Edit an existing driver</div>
    <div class="help-img-text help-img-text-left" style="left: 55px; top: 165px;">Change the order that drivers will appear</div>
</div>

<p>When creating or editing a driver, the following properties can be changed:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> - The name of the driver</li>
<li><strong>Color</strong> - The background color used for the driver on the schedule</li>
<li><strong>Is active?</strong> - Determines if the driver will be shown in various places. The most common usage is to flag former (or current) employees that no longer drive for your team.</li>
<li><strong>Include in general reports?</strong> - Log data from trips by this driver will be included on reports. Also determines if the driver can be selected in certain places, such as when filing a vehicle issue. Generally, employed drivers should be included, while volunteers should not.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h4>Vehicles</h4>

<p>The <strong><a href="{% url 'vehicles' %}">Vehicles</a></strong> page can be accessed via the main menu under <em>Vehicles &gt;&gt; Vehicles</em>.</p>

<p>When creating or editing a vehicle, the following properties can be changed:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> - The name of the vehicle</li>
<li><strong>Is active?</strong> - Determines if the vehicle will be shown in various places. The most common usage is to flag decommissioned vehicles.</li>
<li><strong>Report mileage/service hours?</strong> - Log data for trips by with this vehicle will be included entirely on reports. When turned off, this data won't be applied to certain totals. It may make sense to turn this off, for example, on a staff member's personal vehicle.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h4>Trip Types</h4>

<p>The <strong><a href="{% url 'triptypes' %}">Trip Types</a></strong> page can be accessed via the main menu under <em>Schedule &gt;&gt; Trip Types</em>.</p>

<p>For monthly reports that require a breakdown of trips by type, said types can be set up here. Again, the interface here is identical to editing drivers and vehicles. Trip types have the following properties:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> - The name of the trip type</li>
<li><strong>Report trip counts?</strong> - Determines if trips flagged with this type are counted in the relevant sections of reports.</li>
</ul>
